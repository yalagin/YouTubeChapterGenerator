Having lived in Bangkok for 12 months and paid only 400 dollars for rent, I can confidently say that this content is some of the best value for money. Whether you find it on Facebook or in one of the many groups, you won’t be disappointed. You can find many places to hang out, a garden, and a stunning illumination of lights and waterfalls. It looks luxurious and I would love to have something like this at home, but it’s difficult to build and maintain. The security here is top-notch, with face recognition and key cards needed to enter the building. Even the doors have sensors that scream if they are not closed properly. Another convenience is the vending machines that provide snacks and drinks at any time of the day. There are also decorations everywhere, including a wall that looks great. 

The bathrooms are equipped with Japanese toilets, and the coffee machines provide a futuristic feel. You can even order fresh groceries and have them delivered right to your door. Parking lots have toilets and elevators that take you directly to your apartment. Smoking is only allowed in a designated area, as there have been many fires in skyscrapers in China. 

One of the best places to eat is the Pavilion, where you can sit and enjoy the view of the waterfall. The first floor can be dirty, so it’s best to find a seat on the second floor. There is even a shrine where Thai people can offer liquids to the gods. Food can be ordered from the local store and delivered by a grab guy. 

Finally, there is a 7-Eleven nearby, but it’s small and can be quite crowded. If you’re looking for a more luxurious option, there is a large 7-Eleven located near a metro station. Once you cross the bridge, you can turn right and find your apartment. Inside, you will find a washing machine, a luggage storage, a working desk, and a city view. You can also watch Netflix and YouTube while chilling in your room. All in all, it’s a great place to live and offers amazing value for money.

I recently rented a room in Thailand that was quite nice. It was a 4K 2E room, with plates and a dishwasher. It was quite small, but it had its own privacy and convenience. I found some of the plates on the streets, and the top of the table was given to me by a friend. I also had some items from my girlfriend. The room was wrapped in plastic when I entered, and I really enjoyed it. 

It's difficult to find a room with a similar value for money anywhere else in the world, except Thailand and Malaysia. Europe is an option, but it's hard to find a room with the same high quality standards. 

My experience in the room made me think about all of the problems we have in the world. I wish I could find an answer, but I'm so frustrated. Even when the sun is out, the sky still looks gray. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, but I'm still hoping I can take a chance and find a solution.
