like 150 dollars yeah this is smoking area and you can go by by the way later go this way and just walk yeah over here well you can work in the lobby but in the first floor there is a really really cold air conditioner like right here and a lot of people walking so it's best to work on the second floor but there's a competition to work on the second floor because everyone want to stay here
