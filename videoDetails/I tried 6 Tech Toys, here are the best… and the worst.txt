00:00: it used to be that kids wanted to be, 00:01: astronauts and and doctors but now they, 00:04: want to be twitch streamers or YouTubers, 00:06: so I guess it makes sense that the, 00:08: market has been flooded with poisoned, 00:10: gadgets that cater to this aspiration, 00:12: the question is are they all E-Waste or, 00:15: are some of them a great way to turn, 00:17: your kid into the next Paul brother, 00:22: because it turns out kids Tech is a lot, 00:24: more interesting than I expected here's, 00:26: some pirated retro games running on a, 00:28: leapfrog educational gaming system and, 00:31: oh how about this fully functional, 00:33: camera and green screen playset and look, 00:36: at this thing yes that is Microsoft, 00:38: teams running on a hundred dollar Junior, 00:40: tablet from VTEC look at this it can, 00:43: even run this Segway to our sponsor, 00:45: build Redux imagine building your dream, 00:48: gaming rig and then actually buying it, 00:51: customize your build any way you want, 00:53: and let build Redux do the heavy lifting, 00:55: all at a price competitive to building a, 00:57: PC yourself check out build Redux at the, 01:00: link below first up we've got the plan, 01:02: toys vlogger kit I really don't know how, 01:05: I would feel about buying this for my, 01:06: children it includes a camera ring light, 01:08: microphone and pack and a camera stand, 01:11: oh and I opened it upside down uh it's, 01:13: just wood, 01:15: but it has a shutter button that you can, 01:17: press uh oh a viewfinder you can look, 01:21: through and a little mirror on the back, 01:22: to train you to be so into yourself, 01:26: what else we got carry case is this as, 01:29: funny as I think it is am I am I missing, 01:31: something here my microphone just put oh, 01:34: wait there's oh there's no, 01:37: really there's no clip put it in the, 01:40: pocket and all right well I'm a little, 01:43: shorter than a child a little okay there, 01:46: we go and that's it I'm ready for my, 01:49: daily Vlog this is a weird material how, 01:52: are you gonna see yourself when you take, 01:54: it no way no way no way it has a flip up, 01:59: display okay I could see this being kind, 02:02: of fun for kids and it's not really that, 02:04: much dumber than a blender that doesn't, 02:06: work though it is dumber than our next, 02:08: product, 02:09: the kitty zoom Creator cam from VTEC is, 02:12: a 5 megapixel digital camera that can, 02:14: record video in 720p has 256 megabytes, 02:17: of internal storage and a Charming, 02:20: navigation sound that definitely won't, 02:22: drive you crazy immediately, 02:26: that's not bad, 02:29: picture and sound quality aren't the, 02:30: best in the world they're about, 02:31: comparable to what you'd get with the, 02:33: built-in webcam and mic on a mid-range, 02:34: laptop and the advertised Focus range is, 02:37: 1.5 feet the lens flips around oh cool I, 02:42: feature reminiscent of the old perfume, 02:44: bottle-shaped Sony kw1 most cameras, 02:47: these days opt for the screen to flip, 02:48: around but I guess on a camera where the, 02:51: screen is more expensive than the camera, 02:52: it makes more sense to do it this way, 02:54: even though that screen is more, 02:56: expensive than the camera by the way, 02:57: that doesn't mean it's amazing the, 02:59: viewing angles are yeah, 03:01: kind of usable vertically but this is, 03:03: definitely a TN panel so your mileage, 03:06: may vary in order to save 720p video, 03:08: you'll need to make use of the micro SD, 03:10: slot which only officially supports up, 03:12: to 32 gig cards but we were able to use, 03:14: a 128 gig with no issues and the, 03:16: internal rechargeable battery lasts for, 03:18: about 45 minutes to an hour of recording, 03:20: time though files are limited to two, 03:22: gigabytes in size or around 13 minutes, 03:25: the included tripod attaches using a, 03:27: standard quarter 20 screw so the camera, 03:29: can be held on a ton of different mounts, 03:31: and while it's obviously not going to be, 03:32: comparable to a more expensive GoPro or, 03:34: something like that the footage is, 03:36: usable the interface is simple and the, 03:39: overall ruggedness of it means that I, 03:40: would actually, 03:42: this in the hands of my kids look they, 03:44: were even smart enough to make the lens, 03:46: not touchable with your fingers it's, 03:48: recessed genius the number of times I've, 03:51: had to tell my kids don't touch the lens, 03:53: now you can't, 03:55: yeah Disco Tree let's go look at me I'm, 03:59: in a disco, 04:02: considering how little processing is in, 04:05: this camera, 04:06: that is really good, 04:08: what the heck is a Leapster Explorer and, 04:11: where was this when I was a kid it's a, 04:13: cartridge based system released in 2010, 04:15: by LeapFrog as a continuation of their, 04:18: Leapster lineup it has half a gig of, 04:20: internal storage 64 Megs of DDR RAM and, 04:23: a 393 megahertz lf-1000 processor which, 04:27: is an arm 9 magicized Pollux SOC that, 04:30: was rebranded to be used on various, 04:31: LeapFrog devices why did LeapFrog feel, 04:34: the need to Rebrand the processor well, 04:36: because they're a serious tech company, 04:37: that makes serious Hardware that's, 04:40: probably why their devices also ran a, 04:42: custom version of Linux a move which is, 04:44: seen this device receive a plethora of, 04:46: mods over the last decade including, 04:48: internet access overclocking and the, 04:51: ability to run Doom one of the few mods, 04:54: that doesn't require serial Port access, 04:56: is the installation of retro leap a, 04:58: spin-off of retroarch that's designed, 05:00: specifically for Leapfrog devices now, 05:02: unfortunately the Leapster Explorer's, 05:05: meager system specs prior to, 05:06: overclocking means that emulation is, 05:08: going to be limited to Game Boy and Ness, 05:10: but for a device that costs about as, 05:13: much as four Big Macs, 05:15: that's pretty reasonable especially if, 05:17: you also plan on using it as a learning, 05:19: tool for the other mods available if you, 05:21: want to do more advanced simulation, 05:22: without the work of installing an rs-232, 05:24: cable the Leapster Explorer GS from 2012, 05:28: has the LF 2000 processor a rebranded, 05:31: nexcel nxp 3200 and can apparently run, 05:34: Game Boy advanced and Super Nintendo, 05:36: games quite smoothly our Leapster, 05:38: Explorer GS unfortunately though can't, 05:39: do any of that since its corroded well, 05:41: beyond use and these units have become, 05:43: increasingly rare I mean that's the risk, 05:45: we take when we buy used electronics, 05:47: designed for people who can't keep the, 05:48: saliva in their mouths liquid and, 05:50: electronics don't mix folks if only that, 05:52: drool had fallen on a keyboard inspired, 05:54: towel from lttstore.com for something a, 05:57: bit newer we also picked up the LeapPad, 05:59: Academy from LeapFrog or well, 06:02: sorta from LeapFrog more on that in a, 06:04: minute this bad boy is a 7-inch tablet, 06:07: with no Bluetooth no NFC no gimmicks, 06:09: none of that needless bulk it runs a, 06:12: custom version of Android 10 that's, 06:13: reminiscent of an Amazon device meaning, 06:15: that it lacks Google Play services and, 06:18: can only install new apps from, 06:19: leapfrog's own app store or curiously, 06:23: the Amazon app store, 06:25: spec wise the screen is 1024x552 it has, 06:29: one gig of RAM 16 gigs of internal, 06:31: storage and uses a rock chip rk3266 SOC, 06:34: now thanks to Amazon's app store's, 06:37: inclusion of send files to TV we were, 06:40: able to side load apks that we, 06:42: downloaded from sketchy looking websites, 06:44: and even got teams working, 06:47: sort of video apps like jellyfin and, 06:49: Plex did play though not without hiccups, 06:51: along the way YouTube wasn't too, 06:53: forgiving about the lack of Play, 06:55: services so we were limited to web, 06:56: browsers for that but it still plays, 06:59: video Even if we could best describe the, 07:01: quality as, 07:02: premium potato it might not be able to, 07:05: do much or do it that well but as far as, 07:07: security goes it's pretty secure ish, 07:09: apps seem to close completely when they, 07:12: aren't in use the lack of Play services, 07:13: makes compatibility extremely limited, 07:16: the requirement of a parental password, 07:17: to access any newly installed app will, 07:20: make you think twice before opening, 07:21: something and even though Android 10 has, 07:23: past its end of life the age of the, 07:25: Target demographic for the device means, 07:27: that LeapFrog has a reason to keep, 07:28: pushing security updates as they're, 07:30: needed personally I'm a big fan of the, 07:32: child sized finger stylus that it, 07:34: includes awesome man you'd have a hard, 07:37: time damaging the screen with that you'd, 07:39: try though similarly security updates, 07:41: will also continue to get pushed for the, 07:43: Kitty Buzz 3. this Android 10 based, 07:47: pseudo phone from VTEC aside from, 07:49: showing off the flippable camera there's, 07:50: not really too much to say about the, 07:52: Kitty Buzz 3 oh my God it's a zoom lens, 07:54: okay I thought it was a privacy shutter, 07:56: well anyway the reason there's not much, 07:58: to say about it is because if we put it, 07:59: side by side with the LeapPad Academy we, 08:02: can see that there is not much of a, 08:04: difference the LeapPad has a bigger, 08:06: battery double the internal storage a, 08:08: different screen and a slightly, 08:09: different UI but under the hood they are, 08:11: fundamentally the same device this is, 08:13: the legacy of vtax 2017 buyout of, 08:16: LeapFrog Enterprises there are very few, 08:19: competitors in the market of electronic, 08:20: edutainment so designing devices with as, 08:23: much overlap as possible maximizes, 08:25: profit so no longer are they rebranding, 08:27: socs rolling their own Linux or doing, 08:30: things in a really cool extremely, 08:31: hackable manner which is disappointing, 08:34: but an inevitability so whether it was, 08:36: once two device manufacturers there's, 08:38: now one device manufacturer making the, 08:40: same product in a different box with, 08:43: different Navigation sounds what better, 08:45: way to hear those navigation sounds than, 08:47: with a pair of appropriately sized, 08:48: headphones oh my goodness these look, 08:51: awful the LOL surprise kid safe, 08:54: headphones advertise exactly one feature, 08:57: that they limit volume so that you don't, 09:00: hurt your delicate little kid ears and, 09:02: in that regard they actually function as, 09:04: advertised maxing out at exactly 84.2, 09:07: decibels with music playing that is, 09:10: within one decibel of the stated 85, 09:12: decibels functionally though they are, 09:15: quite lacking in both bass and treble, 09:17: which leaves vocal sounding dark and, 09:19: muffled the plastic is cheap feeling and, 09:21: the cable is so thin you could probably, 09:23: floss your teeth with them so I wouldn't, 09:25: expect these to survive for very long on, 09:27: the other end of the spectrum though, 09:28: these Puro sound Labs bt2200 Bluetooth, 09:31: kids headphones appear to be quite, 09:33: sturdy and they advertise a tiny bit, 09:36: more in terms of features on top of an, 09:38: 85 decibel limit they claim Studio grade, 09:40: audio which is obviously Market, 09:43: nonsense but they do have a feature that, 09:45: allows them to be Daisy chained so you, 09:47: can have multiple headphones plugged in, 09:49: together over micro USB that is great, 09:51: for preventing fights in the back seat, 09:53: of a car the frequency response on these, 09:55: headphones is actually fairly decent, 09:57: with only a slightly over emphasized, 09:59: bass and underemphasized treble range, 10:01: and while the microphone is missing much, 10:03: more bass and treble for a headset mic, 10:05: the quality is right in range with our, 10:07: expectations they're also a lot more, 10:08: comfortable out of the box and Puro even, 10:10: sells optional over ear pads so you can, 10:13: tweak it to the user's preference with, 10:14: some proper care these should actually, 10:16: last quite some time before hitting the, 10:18: donation bin I actually love that they, 10:20: have some decent padding on the headband, 10:21: as well and that's what we're really, 10:23: focusing on here the point of finding, 10:24: usefulness in children's toys isn't just, 10:26: about justifying you know a new, 10:28: off-the-shelf item it's that growing up, 10:30: is a fact of life and once something has, 10:32: been handed down to the youngest in the, 10:34: family it's destined to go somewhere, 10:36: else and we would just prefer that it, 10:38: not be the landfill if it could end up, 10:40: at the thrift shop or in the hands of, 10:42: that weird neighbor kid that always show, 10:43: goes up at your house Uninvited and, 10:44: wants to eat your food and I'd say the, 10:46: big winners here are any of the old, 10:48: hackable devices you can get your hands, 10:49: on I actually really like that camera, 10:51: green screen kit I think that'd be a ton, 10:52: of fun for my kids and these Puro sound, 10:54: Labs headphones not bad just like this, 10:57: not bad segue
